# Elofsson and AF3-server predictions for CASP16

## Organisation
The file Targets.MD contains comments about predictions and choices made for each target

## Code

in bin/ all scripts used during the predictions are made available


## Targets
All submitted targets for Elofsson (#241) and AF3-server (#304) can be found in targets/ (gzipped)


## Scores
The file scores.csv contains all the pTM/ipTM/Ranking_confidence values for all models generated. In most cases the highest ranking_confidence score relates to the Elofsson prediction. and the fold_XYYYY_summary_confidences_0 related to the prediction submitted as the AF3-server. However, for large targets and round 0 models this is not always the case. Note also that for round 1 models often round 0 models are submitted. Due to space limitations 

## Models
All models will be uploaded to a figshare repository ASAP. A preliminary link to the repository is here https://figshare.com/s/0df8bc3bef2dbd7e057f
