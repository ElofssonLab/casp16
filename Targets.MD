# CASP 16

The Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP) is a community-wide, worldwide experiment for protein structure prediction taking place every two years since 1994. CASP provides an objective measure of the state of the art in protein structure prediction, covering all aspects from secondary structure prediction to tertiary structure, and more recently quaternary structure prediction. Participants are provided with the amino acid sequence of proteins for which the structure is known but not yet released to the public. They are then asked to predict the three-dimensional structure of these proteins. The predictions are evaluated objectively once the experimental structures become public
